# ServiceFinder

**ServiceFinder** is a mobile application built with **React Native**, designed to help users find and book various home and professional services such as **cleaning**, **plumbing**, **electrical work**, **painting**, **car towing** and more.  
The goal of this project is to make it easier for people to quickly find and book trusted service providers anytime they need — at different price ranges and categories.

## Project Overview

ServiceFinder provides a simple and efficient way for users to:

- **Browse available services** by category and filters (price, rating, distance).
- **Book a service** for a specific date or time.
- **Chat** directly with service providers.
- **Post your own service** if you want to offer something (e.g. cleaning, plumbing, etc.).
- **Manage your personal profile** including name, contact info, and image.

Currently, the project is in its **first phase**, which includes only the **UI (User Interface)**.  
The upcoming phase will implement backend integration and database functionalities.
