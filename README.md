# 🧩 ServiceFinder

**ServiceFinder** is a mobile application built with **React Native**, designed to help users find and book various home and professional services such as **cleaning**, **plumbing**, **electrical work**, **painting**, and **car towing**.

## 🧭 Project Overview

ServiceFinder provides a simple and efficient way for users to:
- 🔍 **Browse available services** by category and filters (price, rating, distance).  
- 📅 **Book a service** for a specific date or time.

- ➕ **Post your own service** if you want to offer something (e.g. cleaning, plumbing, etc.).
